## Indian Women in Tech Community Code of Conduct ##

“Indian Women in Tech” in this document refers to the Indian Women in Tech chat group at [indian-women-in-tech.slack.com](http://womenintech.slack.com). “The administrators” refers to the administrators on this organization, a list is available at the top of the [Team Directory](https://womenintech.slack.com/team) (must be a member of the organization to view).

Indian Women in Tech is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all Indian Women in Tech spaces, including public channels, private channels and direct messages, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the administrators.

Some Indian Women in Tech spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

### Harassment includes: ##

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
- Threats of violence

- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse

### Indian Women in Tech prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The administrators will not act on complaints regarding: ###

- “Reverse”-isms, including “reverse racism,” “reverse sexism,” and “cisphobia”
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
- Communicating in a “tone” you don’t find congenial
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Reporting ##

If you are being harassed by a member of Indian Women in Tech, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact [@sj](https://indian-women-in-tech.slack.com/team/sj) or [@bhavika](https://indian-women-in-tech.slack.com/team/bhavika) directly via DM.

This code of conduct applies to Indian Women in Tech spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of Indian Women in Tech outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Indian Women in Tech members, especially the administrators, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from Indian Women in Tech based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Indian Women in Tech spaces and behavior towards people who are not in Indian Women in Tech.

In order to protect volunteer admins from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Indian Women in Tech members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences ##

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Indian Women in Tech spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Indian Women in Tech members or the general public.
